# Star Wars Hangman

## Game Description

This is your classic hangman game with a Star Wars twist. 

### Game Directions

Underscores for a Star Wars-themed word will automatically populate when you open the game. To get started, just press any key to begin guessing. As you guess, correct letters will populate the given underscores, and incorrect guesses will populate under "Letters already guessed" displayed on the screen. A letter can only be guessed once, and for each wrong guess, "Number of guesses remaining" will decrease by 1. You have 10 chances to guess the word. Once you win or lose, the game will reset in 5 seconds. 

This game has audio. You will hear different sound bytes for correct and incorrect guesses, in addition to winning and losing sounds.
